# JHipster generated kubernetes configuration

You need to export environment variables for email sender:

```
export FLATTER_EMAIL_LOGIN=email@email.com
export FLATTER_EMAIL_PASSWORD=password
```

This application was generated using JHipster 6.0.1, you can find documentation and help at [https://www.jhipster.tech/documentation-archive/v6.0.1](https://www.jhipster.tech/documentation-archive/v6.0.1).

You will need to push your image to a registry. If you have not done so, use the following commands to tag and push the images:

```
$ docker image tag flatterservermonolith akulinski/flatterservermonolith
$ docker push akulinski/flatterservermonolith
```

1. [Node.js][]: We use Node to run a development web server and build the project.
   Depending on your system, you can install Node either from source or as a pre-packaged bundle.

You can deploy all your apps by running the below bash command:

```
./kubectl-apply.sh
```

## Exploring your services

Use these commands to find your application's IP addresses:

Npm is also used to manage CSS and JavaScript dependencies used in this application. You can upgrade dependencies by
specifying a newer version in [package.json](package.json). You can also run `npm update` and `npm install` to manage dependencies.
Add the `help` flag on any command to see how you can use it. For example, `npm help update`.

The `npm run` command will list all of the scripts available to run for this project.

### Service workers

Service workers are commented by default, to enable them please uncomment the following code.

- The service worker registering script in index.html

```html
<script>
  if ('serviceWorker' in navigator) {
    navigator.serviceWorker.register('./service-worker.js').then(function() {
      console.log('Service Worker Registered');
    });
  }
</script>
```

\$ kubectl get svc flatterservermonolith

```

## Scaling your deployments

You can scale your apps using

```

\$ kubectl scale deployment <app-name> --replicas <replica-count>

```

## zero-downtime deployments

The default way to update a running app in kubernetes, is to deploy a new image tag to your docker registry and then deploy it using

```

\$ kubectl set image deployment/<app-name>-app <app-name>=<new-image>

```

Using livenessProbes and readinessProbe allows you to tell kubernetes about the state of your apps, in order to ensure availablity of your services. You will need minimum 2 replicas for every app deployment, you want to have zero-downtime deployed. This is because the rolling upgrade strategy first kills a running replica in order to place a new. Running only one replica, will cause a short downtime during upgrades.

## Monitoring tools

### JHipster console

Your application logs can be found in JHipster console (powered by Kibana). You can find its service details by
```

\$ kubectl get svc jhipster-console

```

* If you have chosen *Ingress*, then you should be able to access Kibana using the given ingress domain.
* If you have chosen *NodePort*, then point your browser to an IP of any of your nodes and use the node port described in the output.
* If you have chosen *LoadBalancer*, then use the IaaS provided LB IP

## JHipster registry

The registry is deployed using a headless service in kubernetes, so the primary service has no IP address, and cannot get a node port. You can create a secondary service for any type, using:

```

\$ kubectl expose service jhipster-registry --type=NodePort --name=exposed-registry

```

and explore the details using

### Packaging as jar

To build the final jar and optimize the flatterservermonolith application for production, run:

    ./mvnw -Pprod clean verify

This will concatenate and minify the client CSS and JavaScript files. It will also modify `index.html` so it references these new files.
To ensure everything worked, run:

    java -jar target/*.jar

Then navigate to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in your browser.

Refer to [Using JHipster in production][] for more details.

### Packaging as war

To package your application as a war in order to deploy it to an application server, run:

    ./mvnw -Pprod,war clean verify

## Testing

To launch your application's tests, run:

    ./mvnw verify

### Client tests

Unit tests are run by [Jest][] and written with [Jasmine][]. They're located in [src/test/javascript/](src/test/javascript/) and can be run with:

    npm test

For more information, refer to the [Running tests page][].

### Code quality

Sonar is used to analyse code quality. You can start a local Sonar server (accessible on http://localhost:9001) with:

```

\$ kubectl get svc exposed-registry

```

You can run a Sonar analysis with using the [sonar-scanner](https://docs.sonarqube.org/display/SCAN/Analyzing+with+SonarQube+Scanner) or by using the maven plugin.

Then, run a Sonar analysis:

```

./mvnw -Pprod clean verify sonar:sonar

```

If you need to re-run the Sonar phase, please be sure to specify at least the `initialize` phase since Sonar properties are loaded from the sonar-project.properties file.

```

./mvnw initialize sonar:sonar

```

or

For more information, refer to the [Code quality page][].

## Troubleshooting

> my apps doesn't get pulled, because of 'imagePullBackof'

check the registry your kubernetes cluster is accessing. If you are using a private registry, you should add it to your namespace by `kubectl create secret docker-registry` (check the [docs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/pull-image-private-registry/) for more info)

> my apps get killed, before they can boot up

This can occur, if your cluster has low resource (e.g. Minikube). Increase the `initialDelySeconds` value of livenessProbe of your deployments

> my apps are starting very slow, despite I have a cluster with many resources

The default setting are optimized for middle scale clusters. You are free to increase the JAVA_OPTS environment variable, and resource requests and limits to improve the performance. Be careful!

    ./mvnw -Pprod verify jib:dockerBuild

> my SQL based microservice stuck during liquibase initialization when running multiple replicas

Sometimes the database changelog lock gets corrupted. You will need to connect to the database using `kubectl exec -it` and remove all lines of liquibases `databasechangeloglock` table.

For more information refer to [Using Docker and Docker-Compose][], this page also contains information on the docker-compose sub-generator (`jhipster docker-compose`), which is able to generate docker configurations for one or several JHipster applications.

## Continuous Integration (optional)

To configure CI for your project, run the ci-cd sub-generator (`jhipster ci-cd`), this will let you generate configuration files for a number of Continuous Integration systems. Consult the [Setting up Continuous Integration][] page for more information.
